# AP Computer Science Website

This is a website I've created to replace the one that my AP Computer Science class currently uses.

## Getting Started

This is a website code. I'm not quite sure how to run it but I believe that you should be able to have it up and running.

### Prerequisites

A Web Browser? HTML is pretty easy to code.
